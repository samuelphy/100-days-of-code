# Exercise 5   Take the following Python code that stores a string:â€˜

str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:  0.8475'
# Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the
# colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted string
# into a floating point number.

substr_pos = str.find(':')
substr = str[substr_pos+1:]
substr = substr.strip()
fnumber = float(substr)
